## 5 Tools for writing better lyrics

1. Use sensory language: Taste, Touch,Sight, Smell, Sound
2. Tell us a story: 
3. Avoid clichÃ©s
4. Save something for later
5. Try and write a great chorus

Chorus few words in Beatles


## Crafting Better Melodies

- Motion creates Emotion

- Stepwise motion: Move into the scale
- Intervals: Jump into notes from the chord
- Rub Notes: Notes out of the chord
- Next notes: Notes next to chord
- Use your range in Sing
- Verse low range and the chorus jump range or mixed

Repetition is an intensifier

## Arranging: Rule of Threes

* The Lead: 
* The Rhythm section:
* The wild card:

Cognitive Load: Amount of brain used to listen

## Studio Performance

- Don't supress the emotion
- Performance trumps everything

## Programmed tracks

Hard sometimes when is alone, some strategies for not losing objectivity:

- Give yourself some space: Don't loop all the time.
- Remember the rule of threes:
- Record a rough take of the lead as soon as you can 
- Don't be afraid to simplify

## Singers: Virtuoso vs. Vibe

- Most important thing in the record is the vocals.
- Virtuoso: Range,technique.
- Vibe: Limited range.
- Most important thing is the human factor.
- Sing the words
- Tell the story

## Producing vocals

* Perception is a key
* Make singer comftortable 
* Find the right microphone for the singer
* Vocal mic shootout: Try which mic sounds better
* Some singers sound different depending on the mic, some of them not
* Diction: Put the letter sounds
* Inhabit the role.

Sometimes is not the day

## Defining the sonic signature

What doo you want this record to sound like?
Lo-Fi
Brightness: High end frequencies, take care of the popping and s sounds
Wetness and Dry: Reverb, echo and delay
Compression:

## Single sound recording

1. Single Point-Source Recording: Using one microphone to pich a recording
- Smartphone
* Where is the Mic located?

Phone: High Pass Filter 250Hz Aprox
A/D converter
Stereo recording

2. Stereo digital recorders

3. Laptop

*Is better to use a external mic

4. Mic Placement

## Multi track recording

Les paul Mary ford track history

* Get an interface and a few microphones
* Get comfortable recording witch click tracks or drum loops
* Keep in mind how your tracks will fit together

"The absence of limitations is the enemy of art"

## Sound absorbtion vs Sound Proofing

* Is the space quiet enough?
* Not necessarilly must be soundproff, but rather it to be.
* Materials that absorb spund: Blanket hang in the wall
* Sound proofing: Isolation and double walls

- Sound Absorption: Keeping reflections from bouncing back to you
- Sound proofing: Keeping outside sounds from coming in or sound from inside the studio going out.

## Acoustic Spaces & Mic Placement

Dry space: Reflections are less -> More options later on
Wet space: More reflections -> Cloud signical, less inteligible

Mic placement: Closer -> less ambience and more prescence
Try to keep the distance

Cannot get the reverb out when is in the signal

## Microphone Types and Pick up patterns

* Dynamic: SM57 for instruments, SM58 for Vocal: Low failure and sound great.
 Cardioid: Diaphragm , Very direccional. Great for stage and percussions

* Condenser: They have a battery, Phantom power, 
	able to change the pattern: cardioid, supercardioid, bi direccional and omni directional.

* Ribbon: magnet/ribbon/magnet more darker low eq.
            Warm, distort easily and , dont send phantom power

Plosives (P's, B's and D's) expelling wind

Pop filter
or singer from the side

## Layering

* Vocals
	- Pan
	- Doubling L and R
	- Tripling L and R and center

* Backgound vocals: Add tripling to tripling lead vocals

* Instruments
	- Rythm guitar, played along like 6 times
	- Acoustic guitar could do the same effect
Two guitars L and R and vocals in the middle

## Guitar Micing clinic

- Acoustic guitar: Double the guitar with one microphone.
			-Pan L and R and Vocals in the center
 		-Place it in between the neck and the body merges
	-90 degree technique 2 mics
	- 2 mics spacing, body-neck and body
## Application of technology to Art

* What technology do I have access to?

- Acoustic singer: Interface 2 mic preamps and good guitar Mic and good vocal mic to record simoultaneosly
- Drummer: 8 channel interface - mics for kick, drums,snare and overhead and the drum
